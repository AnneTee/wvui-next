# wvui-next

This is a re-scaffolding of https://github.com/wikimedia/wvui using Vue 3 and Vite.

## VitePress

To test out the static docs site, run:

```
npm install
npm run styleguide
```

Component documentation lives in markdown files within component source
directories. See `src/components/button/Button.md` and `src/components/radio/Radio.md`
for examples. The generated static pages live in `docs/components` and include
props, events, and slots tables generated by `vue-docgen-cli`. The generated
file is set up in `docs/templates/component.js`.
