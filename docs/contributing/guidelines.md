## How to stay up-to-date

**TODO: update**

To keep all those interested in using or contributing to the library up-to-date on topics of design,
development, roadmaps, and releases, the Design Systems Team will:

-   Include release notes with every release and send minor+ release summaries out to the following
    mailing lists:
    -   [wikitech-l](https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/wikitech-l.lists.wikimedia.org/)
    -   [design.public](https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/design.lists.wikimedia.org/)
-   Use the [WVUI workboard](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/project/view/4898/) in Phabricator to
    publicly track the work, giving others the opportunity to subscribe to tasks, add comments, or
    claim tasks.
-   Fill out the Scrum of Scrums notes that go out to wikitech-l weekly.
