# Developing

This section covers how to work on the library. If you want to contribute code,
please review the [Contributing section](/contributing/guidelines) first to
learn more about our contribution processes and patch requirements.

## Quick start

Get running on your host machine quickly with:

```bash
npm install
npm run styleguide
```

VitePress will start a hot-reloading development server at http://localhost:3000.

## Lots more stuff
